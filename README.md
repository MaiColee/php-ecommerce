Test data provided aside from images in the SQL files.

Test images omitted due to lack of licensing. 

Data uses HTML syntax for formatting in the database. 

.e.g

Images must be stored in a folder named images to be located in the root folder.

All the CRUD is possible through the use of the Seller home.
The log-in page uses cookies and user database checks to restrict "customers" from updating the database.
Users must have the matching UserType to go to their respective create, update and delete or just read pages.
